```
This function compute the cost of the actual state using the
current action $a_t$. The cost is the sum of the conributions regaring
to the burden of a diseases quantifyed in DALYs and the implicated cost,
related with the vaccination campaing.

According to the definition of DALY we compute this indicator with
```math
    \begin{aligned}
        DALY 
            &:= 
                YLL + YLD
        \\
        YLL(t_{k + 1}) 
            &:=
                \int_{t_k}^{t_{k + 1}}
                    m_1  (D(t) - D(t_k))
                dt
        \\
        YLD(t_{k + 1})
            &:= 
                \int_{t_k}^{t_{k + 1}}
                    m_2 (I_S(t) - I_S(t_k))
                dt.
        \\
    \end{aligned}
```
Then we estimate the cost due to the vaccine stock management and
deploy of the underlying vaccination campaing by

```math
    \begin{aligned}
        C_{stock} (t_{k + 1})
            &:=
                \int_{t_k}^{t_{k + 1}}
                    C(K_t)
                dt
        \\
        C_{campaing}(t_{k + 1})
            &:=
                \int_{t_k}^{t_{k + 1}}
                    m_4 (X_{vac}(t) - X_{vac}(t_{k}))
    \end{aligned}
```
